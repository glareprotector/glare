to compare if across all patients, treatments affect different side effects differently.
surgery seems to be no better than brachytherapy or radiation in terms of any side effects  
brachytherapy and radiation seem pretty equal except regarding urinary function
surgery is worse in terms of sexual function, urinary function, and physical condition.
another paper had radiation being worse in terms of physical condition.  here it's not the case.
