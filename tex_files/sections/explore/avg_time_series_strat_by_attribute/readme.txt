avg times series, for patients with high values of attribute(red) and low values(green).  not stratifying by treatment.  but it seems like bowel function after treatment is affected by age a lot, and old and young people had on average the same bowel function before treatment.  physical condition might be associated with age and psa(but psa did not seem to affect physical condition when stratifying by treatment)  sexual function is strongly associated with pre-treatment age and psa.  can't really say anything about urinary function.
